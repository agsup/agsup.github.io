#OOP
### Templates (think `template <typename T>`)
- Note: templates are <b><u>not</u></b> code. It is a template <u>for</u> code 
- Templates give as many classes as there are compatible types
- This implementation should go in the <u><b>header</b></u> file 
	- none of it can go in the source file because of the nature of template syntax/scope
