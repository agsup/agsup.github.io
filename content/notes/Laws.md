# Laws

## Three types of Laws

- Constitutional
- Statutory
- Common/Judge Made
	- "Kindergarten" rules
	- Precedent: What happened previously is important
		- Judges follow previous decisions
	- Judges can overturn rulings if necessary
	- *Stare Decisis*: Standing on decided cases
- The powers given to the judicial branch in Article III are... tiny.
- Supremacy Clause
	- The Constitution and Laws must be made in pursuance of the Supreme Law of the Land,
	- The duty of deciding constitutionality was given retroactively to the Supreme Court (Marbury v. Madison)
		- This is called Judicial Review
