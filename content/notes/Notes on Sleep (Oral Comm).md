# How can students reduce stress through health and wellness?

	- Merrill Mitler: sleep expert and neuroscientist at the National Institute of Health
		- Quote 1 from Dr. Merrill Mitler:
			- "...when we look at well-rested people, they’re operating at a different level than people trying to get by on 1 or 2 hours *less* nightly sleep"
		- Quote 2 from Dr. Mitler:
			- "Sleep services all aspects of our body in one way or another: molecular, energy balance, as well as intellectual function, alertness and mood"
			- A sleep deficit over time can even put you at greater risk for developing depression (from the article, attributed to Mitler)
	- Dr. Michael Twery: NIH sleep expert
		- Quote 1 from Dr. Michael Twery:
			- "Sleep affects almost every tissue in our bodies... It affects growth and stress hormones, our immune system, appetite, breathing, blood pressure and cardiovascular health."
		- On average, we (adults) need 7-8 hours of sleep ( from the article, attributed to Twery)

	- Caffeine helps with being awake, but not with much else
		- Too jittery to be alert
		- Too mentally overstimulated to be present
		- While it is better than with no caffeine, intellectual function still takes a major hit
		- Effects:
			- Difficulty focusing in classes
			- Difficulty absorbing information
			- General decrease in alertness in following days 
3. Secondary Source: Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students [(NIH)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075951/)
	- "Many college students are sleep deprived because they go to sleep late and wake up for classes or employment before adequate sleep is obtained."
	- "Physiologically, adolescents and young adults tend to have a delayed circadian preference, and are “night owls”."
	- "Both high school and college students demonstrate a 1–3 hour sleep deficit on school nights, with a much longer sleep duration and often a later wake time on the weekends."
	- Study at a college prep school: "When school was started at 8.30 am, 30 minutes later than usual, sleep duration was increased by 45 minutes on school days. An unexpected effect was that bedtime shifted earlier by 15 minutes. Following the time change, fewer students reported daytime sleepiness (49.1% to 20.0%), sleepiness in class (85.1% to 60.5%), and falling asleep in class (38% to 18%)."
	- "Sustained wakefulness can impair performance. In an episodic memory-encoding task (face and name recognition), significant deterioration at 6 pm occurred in all subjects, except those who had had a 100-minute nap. In the nap group, not only was performance deterioration abated, but improvement was noted."

	- "**Poor Sleep Habits**. An irregular bedtime, frequent naps, late-night activities, or weekend sleeping-in can scramble your body’s normal sleep/wake schedules. Insufficient and poor quality sleep often becomes a mosaic of cause and effect cemented by habit." (important to note: too many naps is bad)
	- "**Keep a regular sleep schedule**. Wake up at the same time every morning. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, get up at that time as well, even if you go back to bed after ten minutes or so. Experiment with naps. Most students sleep better if they avoid naps, but some sleep better after a nap." (Important to note: Waking up and going back to sleep on weekends <u><b>still helps!</b></u>)
5. Primary Source: Interview
	- Adam Loving: After pulling an all-nighter...
		- Decrease in memory
		- Thinking identically as if under normal conditions
		- Not "tired" as much as "listless" (lacking enthusiasm/energy)
		- Not overtly sleepy
		- Sleepiness is very apparent the next day
## Problems/Solutions
- <b>Problem:</b> Students want to have better, sleep, what are some easily actionable fixes?
	1. Regulate your sleep schedule
		- This allows your internal clock to adjust to a consistent rhythm.
		- Going to sleep at the same time is also very important
		- Waking up at the same time every day is very important (even if you go back to sleep 10 minutes later) (Dartmouth)
	2. Avoid early morning classes (if at all possible)
		- Having your first obligation scheduled later can promote earlier sleep according to the NIH
	3. Naps can be <b><u>crucial</u></b>.
		- Even on a consistent sleep schedule, "sustained wakefulness can impair performance" (NIH). Leaving space for naps can improve cognitive and memory performance drastically over the course of a long day.
