# Elements of Chemistry

- ## Physical and Chemical Properties

  - Physical Properties: properties of a material that can be changed without altering the material's chemistry
    - Ex. Color, texture, etc.
  - Chemical Properties: properties that are caused by an object's chemical properties
    - Ex. rusting/tarnishing

- ## Determining Physical and Chemical Changes

  - Essentially, did the actual material change chemically or not?
    - A paint job is a physical change, rusting is chemical
    - Sanding is a physical change, sodium fusing violently with water is chemical

- ## Elements to Compounds

  - Compounds: Combinations of elements
  - Elemental Formula: A molecule with one type of atom in it
    - Ex. Ozone, diatomic oxygen, diamonds, graphene, sulfur, elemental metals, etc.
  - All compounds are molecules, but not all molecules are compounds
    - The definition for a compound excludes elemental formulas
  - Transition metals have variable charge
    - This is a surprise tool that will help us later

## Naming Compounds

- Greek Prefixes of Note:
  - Hepta, not septa
  - Tetra, not quad
  - The rest are normal prefixes
- Nonmetal changes to -ide when on end of compound
  - Ex. Sodium Chlor**ide**, Carbon Monox**ide**, etc.

Be careful with these 3 polyatomic ions:  

- looks like an element name  
** ends in â€“ide like bonding 2 atoms together

## Balancing Equations

- \_CH~4~ + \_O~2~ -> \_H~2~O + \_CO~2~
  - **1** CH~4~ + **2** O~2~ -> **2** H~2~O + **1** CO~2~

- \_C^+4 + \_O^-2 -> \_CO~2~
  - **1** C^+4 + **2** O^-2 -> **1** CO~2~

- Use algebra brain to solve the things
