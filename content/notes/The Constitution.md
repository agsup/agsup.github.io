# The Constitution
#AMGov 

## Issues
- Small States and Large States
	- Small States wanted equal representation
	- Large States wanted proportional representation
	- This resulted in two legislative houses (House of Reps for proportional, Senate for equal)
- Federalists vs Anti-Federalists
	- How Strong is too Strong?
	- Balance of Power
	- Bill of Rights?
- Slavery
	- If the topic was touched at all, it would not have passed
## Ratification
- All states ratify eventually
- NC and RI initially opposed, but are persuaded
## Coolidge on the Constitution
> To live under the American Constitution
> is the greatest political privilege that was
> <u>ever accorded to the human race</u>
## Blueprint
- A constitution's purpose is to outline the government to which it applies
- Initially, the US judicial branch is super weak
	- NOT GOOD! Too much power to the other branches (especially legislative) can corrupt the government
	- "Absolute power corrupts absolutely"
## A Framework for Discussing a Framework
- Three questions:
	1. The Nature of Man (inherent good or bad?)
	2. What should the ideal structure be
	3. Democracy or Republic?
		- How much do you trust the general public?
## Federalists vs Anti-Federalists
### The Federalists
- Extremely optimistic
- Also suspicious of the general public (*demos*)
- Don't want a direct democracy
### Anti-Federalists
- Less optimistic
- Believe more in the general public
## Nature of Man?
- Sinful, but redeemable
- Not irreversibly Evil Incarnate (see 2-year-old's for an example of Evil Incarnate)
## Democracy or Republic?
- Article 4, Section 4: Republican Government
	- Every state is guaranteed a Republican government (not the party)
## Confederacy or Federal?
- Confederation
	- Loose organization
	- Central gov is weak, individual states have more power
	- Like a club: membership is voluntary
	- Example: EU
- Federal
	- National Gov shares power with states/regional governments
	- Like a marriage: more permanent union
	- Example: US
- Unitary Nation-State
	- Like a child: subject to the parent nation-state
- Constitutions resist change because a volatile document is less effective
	- They are meant as a tool for the people to restrain the government, not the other way around. Otherwise the people will become easily controlled
- Four Main Constitutional Principles
	- Separation of Powers (Checks and Balances)
		- Checks and balances prevent corruption
	- Federalism
	- Judicial Review
	- A Limited Government, Living Constitution
- If humans were angels government would be not only unnecessary, but a hindrance
## Four Principles
- Separation of Powers
	- Bicameralism
	- Checks and Balances
- Federalism
- Judicial Review
- Limited Government with Living Constitution
	- Limited Government
		- Constitution is inherently conservative (resistant to large change)
		- The purpose of the Constitution is to limit Government power, giving the remaining power to the people
		- Patrick Henry: Constitution is for the people to restrain the government, not the other way around
		- Government is limited by rights/liberties of the governed
		- People give government enumerated powers through the Constitution
		- Government actions must be lawful and approved by the governed (indirectly)
	- Living Constitution
		- It grows, takes in resources, responds to the environment, and tries to achieve internal balance within the government
		- It's also short
		- Also vague
			- Flexible, adaptive
## Direct Change
- Amendatory Process
- Requires a large percentage of the states to change the Constitution
- 33/10,000 proposed amendments have been submitted for ratification
- Only 27 have been ratified
