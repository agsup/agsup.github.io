<h1 style="text-align:center;">Kings 1</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Theme: Solomon<br>Topic: Overly Committed</h2>

### David Appoints Solomon (1-2)
- David ruled for 40 years
- He is feeble (old age/Abishag, slightly senile), so son Adonijah exalts himself (horses, chariots, 50 runners)
	- Note: Abishag is a woman who "sleeps next to" (does <b><u>not</u></b> have sex with) David
- Nathan and Bathsheba "remind" him that he chose Solomon to be king, so David installs Solomon as acting King
- David's instructions to Solomon
	1. Obey God
	2. Judge my Enemies
- Solomon "cleans house" (gets rid of Adonijah, Abiathar, Joab and Shimei)

### Solomon's Wisdom and Wealth (3-4, 10)
- #### Divine Dream
	- God grants Solomon a wish
	- Solomon asks for a discerning mind
	- God blesses Solomon not only with wisdom, but also with affluence (wealth, honor, potential long life)
	- Proves his wisdom through dilemmas (2 prostitutes, 1 child, test to reveal the true mother)
		- "Cut the baby in half!"
- #### Peak of Israel's Glory Days
	- Wealthy (gold, silver, imported Egyptian horses)
	- Land/Peace ("from Dan to Beersheba...")
	- Solomon impresses the Queen of Sheba (Ethiopia/Yemen)
	- Note: People were working towards building monuments/temple, but enjoyed affluence nonetheless

### Solomon builds and Dedicates Temple (5-9)
- Allied with Hiram of Tyre for resources/manpower
- Floor plan mirrors the Tabernacle and Eden
		- 3 Divisions
			- Outer Court
			- Holy Place
			- Most Holy Place
		- Temple contains:
			- Ark of God
			- Cherubs on curtain
			- Flowers on tree-like menorah
			- YHWH's glory
- Temple was made for sacrifices, prayer, and as a dwelling place for YHWH
	- Even foreigners can pray toward it
### Solomon's Apostasy (11)
- 700 foreign wives and 300 concubines
	- Pulled Solomon's heart towards Milcom, Ashtoreth, Chemosh, Molech, etc.
- God was angry (YHWH appeared to Solomon twice!)
- Ahijah the prophet
	- Find Jeroboam, Solomon's taskmaster (no familial bond to Solomon)
	- Ahijah tears his own garment, gives Jeroboam 10 pieces
	- Solomon's son Rehoboam gets 1 piece
		- Each piece represents a tribe
	- Solomon's actions will affect the <b>next generation</b> of kings
### The Divided Kingdom (12-14)
- #### Rehoboam of Judah
	- Jeroboam/12 tribes ask Rehoboam to lighten the load
	- Older advisors say to lessen the load, younger say to make it worse
	- Rehoboam listens to younger advisors (more taxes, more work)
	- For this, the kingdom is torn in two (Israel and Judah)
	- Israel (10 tribes) goes to Jeroboam, Rehoboam gets the leftovers (Judah, 2 tribes)
	- Rehoboam's idolatry
		- He is only spared because of David/God's promise to him
- #### Jeroboam of Israel
	- Jeroboam builds 2 golden calves in Dan and Bethel, appoints non-Levite priests/feasts
	- Prophet comdemns Jeroboam's house
- #### Northern Kingdom
	- Kings Nadab, Baasha, Elah and Zimri did evil like Jeroboam,
	- Each assassinated their predecessor to become king, then died to the next 
	- No stability, and no good kings
- #### Southern Kingdom
	- Some good kings, some bad kings
	- King Abijam
		- Walked in Rehoboam's sins, only reigns because he is in David's lineage
	- King Asa
		- Did right like David (removed idols)
	-
