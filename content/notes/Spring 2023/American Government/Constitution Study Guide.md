## Word Pairs

- Power/Authority
	- Power = Strength, Authority = right

- Laswell's/Lenin's definition of politics

## Three Questions to begin with

1. The Nature of Man
	- Men are not inherently good, so power must be checked using a government
2. Confederacy or Federal
	- Federal is country-level, confederacy is loosely assembled group
3. Democracy or Republic
	- Democracy = short, bloody; Republic = stable

## Three Models - How do Governments Relate?

- Confederation
	- Like a club, loosely tied together
- Federal System
	- Like marriage, a union is made
- Unitary Nation State
	- Like a parent-child relationship, one is beholden to another

	- Monarchy/Oligarchy/Democracy
		- Tyranny (Despots)
	- Demos-kratos (the people rule)
- Democracy/Republic
- Direct Democracy/Representative (Indirect) Democracy
- Democratic/Republican Parties

## Republic

- Form of gov in which representatives elected by the people make and enforce laws and policies
- We are guaranteed this kind of government

## Key Documents

- These need to be known <u>in order</u>
	1. Declaration of Independence
	2. Articles of Confederation
	3. Constitution
	4. Bill of Rights
- Need facts about each of them
- List of important words:

	- Legislation
	- Legislate
	- Legislator
	- Legislature
	- Legislative branch
	- " *Leg-* " means "readable"

## Complaints in the Declaration

- Written to the British primarily, but really to the world
- The colonists were upset because the King is taking tax without giving the colonies representation
- They wanted to be free, meaning that if they couldn't have fair representation from Britain, they would not be a part of Britain
- The King's action made him a *tyrant*

## Weaknesses of the Articles

- Required 9/13 to pass a bill
- Very dependent on states
- No central tax, draft, etc.
- States are independent/sovereign, and there isn't really a central government to fix problems universally

## Structure of the Constitution and BOR

- 7 Articles (first three are the structure of the government)
- First 10 Amendments are the Bill of Rights
- 11-27 are amended in over time

## Constitutional Convention

- Madison writes the Constitution
- Presiding officer is Washington
- Absent is Patrick Henry
- Franklin is also there

## Three Major Factions and the Compromises

### Conflicts

- Big vs. Little States
- Federalists vs. Anti
- Slave vs. Free States

###  Compromises?

- Bill of Rights is an answer to Federalists vs. Anti
- Federalist System is an answer to Federalists vs. Anti
- 3/5 Compromise is an answer to Slave vs. Free States
- Great Compromise is an answer to Big vs. Little States

*Need an example of a compromise between an Article and a BOR amendment*

- Article X is an example because it satisfies the Antifederalists

## Top 10 Constitutional Provisions

- Four Constitutional Principles
	1. Separation of Powers/Checks and Balances
		- Legislative Function
			- Passing Laws
			- Congress
		- Executive Function
			- Carry out, execute, and implement laws
		- Judicial Function
			- Interpret Laws
		- Checks and Balances
			- Ex. Veto/Veto Override
			- Judges appointed by Executive have to be Approved by Legislative
			- etc.
	1. Federalism
		- Calls for political authority to be distributed between a central government and the government of the states (Shared Power)
		- Federal and state government can act directly on the people
		- Each has exclusive powers
		- Political Authority is spread out to prevent power concentration
	1. Judicial Review
	2. Limited Government with a Living Constitution

- When there is too much power in one place, we split it
