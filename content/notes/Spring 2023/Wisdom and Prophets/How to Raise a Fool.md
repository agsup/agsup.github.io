## Who is the Fool?

	- Inept but lucky
	- Gullible yet sincere
	- Blundering but lovable
	- Under this definition, "foolishness" is not a tragic flaw or sin
- A true fool fails to appreciate the concern of the wise and the warning of Jesus
- Becoming this kind of fool is a subtle, four-stage process

## Stage 1: Isolated Acts of Folly

## Stage 2: Folly as Sport

## Stage 4: Blaming Everything But Themselves
