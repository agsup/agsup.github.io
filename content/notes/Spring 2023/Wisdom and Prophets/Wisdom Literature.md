Sophia (Greek)/Hocma (Hebrew): expertise in a given field

The "expertise" that the books are interested in is:

## What is a Proverb ( *Mashal* in Hebrew )?

- Short, pithy sayings of 1-2 lines
- Often based on a comparison (26:11)

- Usually has a deeper, spiritual meaning (20:17)

## How to Study Proverbs

- Meanings are not always immediately apparent
- Requires meditation and thought
- Read a few Proverbs, apply them to a current situation, and ask, "Which choice best demonstrates the feat of the Lord?", or store them away in your mind for later use.
- You can't learn everything in Proverbs all at once

## Wisdom Built into the Universe

- Sophia/Hocma is personified, influential in creation (8:22-31)
	- Anglicized name for this personification is "Lady Wisdom"
- Therefore, Wisdom is observable in the created order
	- Ants, locusts, lizards (30:24-31)
	- Kings (30:31), wicked (21:12), sluggard (24:30-34)
- Egyptian *ma'at* (order of the governing world) is a deity married to the wisdom god
	- Instruction of Amenemope (mid-2nd mill. BC): 30 sayings that are parallel (nearly identical) to Proverbs 22-23
		- This tells us that much of this wisdom is *universal*
		- It also tells us that an ungodly person can still have wisdom, so it is important to listen to and process all advice given, regardless of source
