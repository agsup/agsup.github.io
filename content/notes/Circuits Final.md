## Definitions to know:
- Charge
	- The innate property of atoms
	- Measured in Coulombs (SI Unit)
- Current
	- Charge in Motion
	- Measured in Amperes ($i=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$) ($A$)
- Voltage
	- Potential energy difference per unit charge
	- Measured in Volts ($V=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta q}$) ($V$)
- Resistance
	- Opposition to flow of electrons
	- Measured in Ohms ($R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$) ($\Omega$)
- Capacitance
	- 2 plates separated by an insulator, stores energy in its electric field
	- Measured in Farads ($C = \Sigma \frac{A}{d}$) ($F$)
- Inductance
	- Coil of wires that stores energy in a magnetic field
	- Measured in Henrys ($H$)
- Ground
	- O potential (OV)
- Circuit
	- Source, Load, and a path between them
- Op Amp
	- Voltage at inputs is equal
	- No current enters
	- Allows arcane secret resistor math (see [[Op Amps]])
