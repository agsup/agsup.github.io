# Article Reflections for Quizzes 1 and 2

## Quiz 1

### The Living God is a Missionary God

Before reading this article, I had not really thought about the connection between spreading the gospel across the world to God's promise to Abraham. The usage of this promise to explain properties of God's mission is profound to me and I think the parallels here would be very useful for better processing God's reasons for wanting to spread his kingdom.

### Blessing as Transformation

This article does a good job of touching on all of the benefits that can come from blessing while also making sure to note misconceptions about being blessed (for example, "prosperity gospel"). I like the way it tackles different aspects of blessing one at a time, and in great detail. Something I can apply from this article is being more mindful of God's promise to bless the nations, not with a flawed view of what blessing means but through sharing the Gospel with those around me and explaining more accurately what blessings mean.

### Witness to the World



### The Gospel of the Kingdom

## Quiz 2

### The Master's Plan

### Beyond Loving the World

### Life on Purpose

### Culture, Worldview and Contextualization

One of the things I found especially notable and feel strongly about was the danger of syncretism in the church, especially in the United States. While every first-world country has this problem to an extent, the United States has a particularly large national ego, by which I mean they believe that they're the only country in the world, or (at worst) the only country that matters. I believe that international discussion about what each culture defines certain terms as is very important to have a mutual understanding while discussing important matters. I think the title of that section, "Contextualizing Christianity Is Very Risky", is very apt. An example of this recently is a discussion that my girlfriend and I had about what love means. We both had somewhat similar definitions of the word, but there were plenty of differences in how we process and think about love. Because we had that discussion, the words "I love you" carry much more meaning. I think that discussing definitions of these terms between cultures will have an equally powerful effect on how we discuss Christianity.
