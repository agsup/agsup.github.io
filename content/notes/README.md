# Comp 3450 Project 1: Hangman
### Greg Supratman
- In this project, I developed a hangman game using modular design
- StackOverflow was used (sparingly) to refresh my brain on concepts from last semester
- This project has no error checking, which I would fix if I had more time, but as this was not a requirement for the project, I decided not to implement it.
- I used this project as a reason to learn the basics of using CMake. I personally dislike using Visual Studio (mostly for petty aesthetic reasons), so I use Visual Studio Code for as much as I can. Now that I can compile modular projects like this using CMake, I now have one more tool to make use of, and I can run from Visual Studio for a little bit longer.
