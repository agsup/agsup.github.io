1. The Bible saying it is "Inspired by God" I think means that it is written with God in mind. If a painting is "inspired by nature", it is written with nature in mind. I think that like the inspired painting, the inspired Word is still heavily influenced by the human behind it, though with the inspiration in mind.
2. According to the lecture, scripture claims that both humans and God were equal, whole parts of the Bible. This happens because God acts through the body of the writer, but the writer maintains autonomy, and is enabled by the Spirit of God to write in their own words, but with divine inspiration.
3. The scripture has been meticulously copied throughout the centuries, as well as transmitted orally through generations.
4. The 2 necessary beliefs are:
	- Faith in Divine Revelation
	- Faith in Eyewitness Testimony
