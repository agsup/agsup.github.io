# Chapter 14: Psychological Disorders

## 14-1. Discuss how we draw the line between normality and disorder

- ### **Psychological Disorders**

  - Clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior (APA, 2013)
  - Thoughts, emotions, or behaviors are **dysfunctional** or **maladaptive**
  - Often accompanied by **distress**

## 14-2. Discuss how the medical model and the biopsychosocial approach influence our understanding of psychological disorders

- ### **Early view**

  - Abnormal behavior attributed to **strange forces** (movement of the stars, godlike powers, evil spirits).
  - During the Middle Ages, it was commonly believed that abnormal people were **possessed by devils**
  - “Therapy” often involved **physical and mental torture**

- ### **Philippe Pinel (1745-1826)**

  - Recognized abnormal behavior as **sickness** of the mind
  - Opposed barbaric treatments
  - Said cure requires **humane** treatment
  - Introduced and encouraged reforms and humane treatments

- ### **Medical model**

  - Genetically influenced brain structure and biochemical abnormalities contribute to mental illness
  - Mental **illness** is to be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and treated through therapy, often in a psychiatric hospital.
  - **Hopsitals** replaced **asylums** as a treatment location
  - Reinvigoration of the medical model has come from recent research in genetically influenced abnormalities in **brain structure** and **biochemistry**.

- ### **Biopsychosocial approach**

  - Factors
    - *Biological:* Genetic predispositions and physiological states
    - *Psychological*
    - *Social and cultural:* For example, the eating disorders (1) anorexia nervosa and (2) bulimia nervosa occur mostly in **food-abundant** cultures.
  - **Depression** and **schizophrenia** occur worldwide.
  - The biopsychosocial approach emphasizes that mind and body are inseparable.
  - **Epigenetics**: The study of environmental influences on gene expression that occur without a DNA change.
  - Our environment can affect the *expression* (or not) of a gene, which affects the development of psychological disorders

## 14-3. Describe how and why clinicians classify psychological disorders, and explain why some psychologists criticize the use of diagnostic labels

- Classification aims to **predict** a disorder’s course, suggest appropriate **treatment**, and prompt **research**  

- ### **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders** **(DSM-5)**

  - The most common tool or system for classifying disorders
  - Describes disorders and estimates their occurrence
  - Published by the American Psychiatric Association
  - **DSM-5 Changes**
    - Autism and Asperger’s syndrome = **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**
    - Mental retardation = **intellectual disability**
    - Hoarding disorder and binge-eating disorder added
  - **DSM-5 Criticisms**
    - Wider net pathologizes everyday life; too broad
    - **Subjective** diagnostic labels
    - **Biasing** power of labels
  - **DSM-5 Benefits**
    - Helps mental health professionals **communicate**
    - Useful in **research**
    - Clients are often **relieved** to identify suffering

## **14-4. Explain why there is controversy over** attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

- **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):**  Marked by extreme inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity
**Why is there controversy over ADHD?**
- **Critics claim** ADHD is **over-diagnosed**, leading to overuse of prescription drugs
  - ADHD may in effect be marketed by companies that offer drugs for its treatment (Thomas, 2015).
    - If we hear that we have or our child has ADHD, we are likely to start believing this and paying attention to “symptoms”
  - Environment plays a role in behavior.
    - Energetic child + boring school = ADHD diagnoses?
  - Symptoms displayed sound like the “disorder” of having a **Y chromosome**.
    - ADHD is three times more prevalent in boys than girls.
- **Supporter’s claim** ADHD is not over-diagnosed:
  - More frequent diagnoses due to increased **awareness** of disorder
  - Scientific community agrees ADHD is a real **neurobiological** disorder
  - ADHD coexists with **learning** disorders
  - ADHD may be caused by **heritable**
  - ADHD is treatable with **medications**
- **Bottom line**
  - Extreme inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity can derail social, academic, and work achievements
  - These symptoms can be treated with **medication and other activities**
  - The debate continues over whether normal high energy is too often diagnosed as a psychiatric disorder, and whether there is a cost to the long-term use of stimulant drugs in treating ADHD

## 14-5. Identify the factors that increase the risk of suicide, and describe what we know about non-suicidal self-injury

- Suicide risk increases with **anxiety** and **depression**
- Risk increases with **rebound** of these disorders
- Social suggestions may trigger suicide
- Suicide is often unpredictable

### **Researchers report different group suicide rates**

- National differences
- Racial differences
  - In the U.S., Whites and Native Americans die by suicide twice as often as Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians (CDC, 2012)
- Gender differences
  - Females more likely to **attempt**
  - Males more likely to **complete**
- Trait differences
- Age differences and trends
  - **46-64 year olds** are most likely
  - **those 85 and older** second-highest rate
  - **Teen** rates have fluctuated
- Other group differences
  - Increased with any of following: Rich, nonreligious, single, widowed, divorced
  - Witnessing violence
  - Sexual minorities in an unsupportive environment
  - Alcohol use disorder
- Day-of-the-week and seasonal differences
  - Mid-week (Wednesday)
  - April and May (not winter holidays)

### **Helping someone who is talking about suicide**

- **Listen** and empathize
- **Connect** the person with campus counseling resources or crisis text lines
- **Protect** someone at immediate risk by seeking help

### **Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI)**

- Usually painful, but not fatal
- May cut or burn the skin, hit oneself, insert objects under the nails or skin, or self-administer tattoos
- Typically suicide **gestures** , not suicide **attempts**
- Tend to experience bullying, harassment, or other stress
- More common in adolescence and among females
- Often self-critical and struggle with a range of other problems
- **Why do people hurt themselves?**
  - Find relief from intense **negative thoughts** through pain distraction
  - Attract **attention** and possibly get help
  - Relieve **guilt** by punishing themselves  
  - Get others to change their negative behavior (bullying, criticism)
  - Fit in with a peer group

## 14-6. Discuss whether psychological disorders predict violent behavior

### Logical Disorders and Violence

- Mental disorders seldom lead to violence and clinical prediction of violence is unreliable.
- Most people with disorders are nonviolent and are more likely to be **victims** than **perpetrators** of violence.
- When they are violent, **moral** and **ethical** questions are raised about whether society should hold people with disorders responsible for their violent actions.
  - “Criminally insane”
- The better predictors of violence are **alcohol or drugs, previous violence, gun availability, and brain damage**.

## 14-7. State how many people have, or have had, a psychological disorder, and describe some of the risk factors

- ### Psychological Disorder

  -

 | **Percentage**                                  |     |
 | ----------------------------------------------- |:---:|
 | Depressive disorders or bipolar disorder        | 9.3 |
 | Phobia of specific object or situation          | 8.7 |
 | Social anxiety disorder                         | 6.8 |
 | Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) | 4.1 |
 | Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)           | 3.5 |
 | Generalized anxiety disorder                    | 3.1 |
 | Schizophrenia                                   | 1.1 |
 | Obsessive-compulsive disorder                   | 1.0 |

- U.S.: **1 in 5** adults Americans currently have a disorder or have had one in the past year

- Cultures vary in 28 country studies
  - Lowest rate = Nigeria
  - Highest rate = **U.S.**
- **Immigrant Paradox:** Those *born* to immigrants to the United States at **greater** risk of mental disorder than immigrants (for example, Mexican-Americans born in the U.S.).

### What increases vulnerability to mental disorders?

- Wide range of risk and protective factors for mental disorders
- Predictors of mental health cross ethnic and gender lines
- **Poverty** is a risk factor:
  - Incidence of serious psychological disorders is doubled.
  - Correlation goes both ways
    - Conditions and experiences associated with poverty contribute to the development of psychological disorders.
    - But some disorders, such as **schizophrenia**, can drive people into poverty
- First symptoms are experienced by age 24 for majority of those studied

## 14-8. Distinguish among generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias

### Anxiety Disorders, OCD, and PTSD

- Anxiety is a (usually normal) part of life.
- Some of us are more prone to *notice* and *remember* information **perceived** as threatening (the brain’s danger-detection system becomes **hyperactive**.)
- **Anxiety disorders** are marked by distressing, **persistent** anxiety or maladaptive behaviors that **reduce** anxiety.

### Generalized anxiety disorder

- Person is continually tense, apprehensive, and in a state of autonomic nervous system arousal
  - Worry **continually**, often jittery, on edge, and sleep deprived
  - Lack of concentration on a task
  - Anxiety is **free-floating** (not linked to a specific stressor or threat)
  - Often seen with depression, but usually debilitating even on its own
  - May lead to physical problems (high blood pressure)

### Panic Disorder

- Marked by unpredictable, minutes-long episodes of intense dread in which person may experience terror and accompanying chest pain, choking, or other frightening sensations; often followed by worry over a possible next attack
- **Panic Attacks**: Sudden (unpredictable), minutes-long episodes of intense dread
- Physical symptoms accompany the attack: Irregular heartbeat, chest pains, shortness of breath, choking, trembling, dizziness

### Phobia

- Anxiety disorder marked by a persistent, irrational **fear and avoidance** of a specific object, activity, or situation
- *Specific phobias* include a fear of particular animals, insects, heights, blood, or closed spaces.
- *Social anxiety disorder* (formerly called “social phobia”) is an intense fear of other people’s negative judgments.
- Agoraphobia is fear or avoidance of public situations from which escape may be difficult (should a panic attack occur).
  - People with this disorder avoid social situations (speaking up in a group, eating out, going to parties), and if unable to avoid them, may experience strong symptoms of their anxiety.

## 14-9. Describe OCD

- Characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts (**obsessions**), actions (**compulsions**), or both, that persistently interfere with everyday life
  - Obsessive thoughts are unwanted and seemingly unending
  - Compulsive behaviors are responses to those thoughts
  - More common among teens and young adults
- Other OCD-related disorders
  - Hoarding
  - Body dysmorphic disorder
  - Trichotillomania
  - Excoriation disorder

## 14-10. Describe PTSD

- Characterized by...
  - haunting memories
  - nightmares
  - hypervigilance
  - avoidance of trauma-related stimuli
  - social withdrawal
  - jumpy anxiety
  - numbness of feeling
  - and/or insomnia
- Lingers for **four weeks** or more after a traumatic experience
- Greater risk for posttraumatic symptoms with higher distress
- **Women** are at a higher risk than **men** following a traumatic event
- Most people display **survivor resiliency** by not developing these symptoms after severe stress

## 14-11. Describe how conditioning, cognition, and biology contribute to the feelings and thoughts that mark anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD

### **Conditioning**

- **Classical conditioning** - Conditioning research helps explain how panic-prone people **associate** anxiety with certain cues.
- **Stimulus generalization** - A person who experienced a fearful event later develops fear of **similar events**.
- **Reinforcement -** Maintains fears and anxieties by helping us feel good when **avoiding/escaping** the feared situation reduces anxiety.

### **Cognition**

- Thoughts and memories
- Interpretations and expectations
  - Our interpretations and expectations also shape our reactions.
  - *Hypervigilance*
    - **Attend** to more threatening stimuli
    - **Interpret** ambiguous stimuli as threatening
    - **Remember** threatening events

### **Genes**

- 17 gene variations are associated with typical anxiety disorder symptoms; others are specifically associated with OCD
- Genes regulate neurotransmitter brain levels that heighten the brain’s alarm center
- *Serotonin**:* Influences sleep, mood, attending to threat
  - Note: Serotonin also aids in learning
- *Gluatamate**:* Heightens activity in the brain’s alarm centers

### **Experience**

- Experience affects gene expression
  - Epigenetic marks (often organic molecules) attach to **chromosomes** and turn certain genes on or off
- Traumatic fear-learning experiences can leave tracks in the brain and create fear tracks
  - Fear may create neural pathways within the **amygdala** result in easy inroads for more fear experiences

### **The Brain**

- Brain area over-arousal involves impulse control and habitual behaviors, especially in the **anterior cingulate cortex** (a brain region that monitors our actions and checks for errors, is especially likely to be hyperactive in people with **OCD**)

### **Natural Selection**

- Natural selection shapes some of behaviors that can interfere with daily life when taken to an extreme
  - We seem biologically prepared to fear certain threats—these are easily conditioned and difficult to extinguish.
    - 6 Examples:
      - **Spiders**
      - **Snakes**
      - **Enclosed spaces**
      - **Heights**
      - **Storms**
      - **Darkness**
- Our compulsive acts **exaggerate** behaviors that may have helped with survival
  - Grooming (detecting insects and infections) becomes *hair pulling*
  - Washing becomes *ritual hand washing*

## **14-12. Distinguish between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.**

### **Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder**

- Sadness versus Depression
  - Sadness can be helpful
    - Protects us from **dangerous** thoughts and feelings
    - Lets us slow down
    - Helps us **reassess** life and redirect our energy in promising ways
  - Depression can be seriously maladaptive and disabling
  - Depression is the **leading cause of disability** worldwide (WHO, 2017b)
  - Number **one** reason why mental health services are sought (even though phobias are more common)
  - May have a **seasonal** pattern

### **Major Depression Criteria**

- A person experiences two or more weeks with 5 or more symptoms, at least one of which must be:
  - Depressed mood
  - Loss of interest or pleasure
- These symptoms present themselves in the absence of **drugs** or another **medical condition**
- The DSM-5 classifies major depressive disorder as the presence of at least five of the following symptoms over a 2-week period of time (minimally including depressed mood or reduced interest) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
  - Depressed mood most of the time
  - Dramatically reduced interest or enjoyment in most activities most of the time
  - Significant challenges regulating appetite and weight
  - Significant challenges regulating sleep
  - Physical agitation or lethargy
  - Feeling listless or with much less energy
  - Feeling worthless, or feeling unwarranted guilt
  - Problems in thinking, concentrating, or making decisions
  - Thinking repetitively of death and suicide

## **14-13. Describe how the biological and social-cognitive perspectives help us understand major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.**

### **Bipolar Criteria**

- Person alternates between the hopelessness and lethargy of **depression** and the overexcited state of **mania** (formerly called **manic-depressive** disorder)

### **Mania**

- **Mania:** A hyperactive, wildly **optimistic** state in which dangerously poor **judgement** is common
- Mild mania fuels creativity
- Clusters of genes associated with creativity increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder
- Risk factors for developing bipolar disorder predict greater creativity

### **DSM-5 Changes that affect diagnoses**

- New to DSM-5: *Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder* (reduced child and adolescent diagnoses)
  - for children who have frequent behavior outbursts and are often irritable
- **Less** common but often **more** dysfunctional than major depressive disorder
- Potent predictor of **suicide**
  - **No gender differences**; increased diagnoses among **adolescents** and **Americans**

### **Understanding Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder**

**Any theory of depression must explain at least the following:**

1. Behaviors and thoughts change with depression
2. Depression is widespread
3. Women’s risk of major depressive disorder is roughly double men’s risk
4. Most major depressive episodes end on their own
5. Work, marriage, and relationship stress often precede depression
6. Compared with past generations, depression strikes earlier and affects more people, with the highest rates among young adults in developed countries

### **Biological perspective**

- **Genes and depression**
  - In major **twin** studies, one research team estimated the heritability of major depressive disorder at 40 percent
  - **Linkage analysis** – Studying DNA differences from affected and unaffected family members
  - **Many** genes work together and produce interacting small effects that increase risk for depression.
- **The depressed brain**
  - Brain activity slows during depression and becomes more active during mania
            - Functional connectivity analyses show poor neural communication that explain why people with depression struggle with emotion regulation
- **Neurotransmitters**
  - Neurotransmitter **norepinephrine** is scarce during depression & overabundant during mania
  - Neurotransmitter **serotonin** is scarce/inactive during depression
  - Depression-relieving drugs increase serotonin supplies
  - Repetitive physical exercise decreases depression by increasing serotonin
- **Nutritional effects**
  - A heart-healthy diet reduces risk of developing depression
  - Alcohol misuse can lead to depression  

### **Social-cognitive perspective**

- Diet, drugs, stress, and other environmental influences lay down epigenetic marks/molecular genetic tags that can turn certain genes on or off
- Life is seen through a lens of low self-esteem that feeds depression
  - Self-defeating beliefs and learned **helplessness**
  - Rumination:
    - Compulsive fretting; *overthinking* our problems and their causes
      - Can divert us from thinking about other life tasks
      - Can increase negative moods
  - Negative explanatory style
![](file:///C:/Users/GREGSU~1/AppData/Local/Temp/lu211121wpz.tmp/lu211121wqb*tmp*b88461a33e54970d.png)
- **Depression’s vicious cycle:**

1. ----- are interpreted through
2. A brooding, -----, that
3. Creates a hopeless, -----, that
4. Hampers the way the person -----

- These thoughts and actions, in turn, fuel stressful events, and the cycle continues.
- Therapists recognize this cycle and work to help depressed people break out of it
  - Changing their negative thinking
  - Turning their attention outward
  - Engaging them in more pleasant and competent behavior
![](file:///C:/Users/GREGSU~1/AppData/Local/Temp/lu211121wpz.tmp/lu211121wqb*tmp*ea3f831b735e29d4.png)

## **14-14. Describe the patterns of perceiving, thinking, and feeling that characterize schizophrenia.**

- **Schizophrenia**
  - Characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and/or diminished, inappropriate emotional expression
- **Psychotic** disorders
  - Group of disorders marked by irrational ideas, distorted perceptions, and a loss of contact with reality
**Signs of Schizophrenia**
- ***Positive symptoms:*** **Presence** of **inappropriate** behavior
  - Disturbed perceptions and beliefs
    - Hallucinations: Seeing, feeling, tasting, & smelling things that exist only in the mind
    - Delusions (false beliefs): False beliefs
    - May have paranoid tendencies
  - Disorganized thinking and speech
    - Disorganized speech: **word salad** (senseless speech)
    - Breakdown in *selective attention*
  - Inappropriate emotions/behavior
- *Negative symptoms: **absence** of **appropriate** behavior*
  - Diminished and inappropriate emotions
    - **Flat affect**: Emotionless, a state of no apparent feeling
    - *Impaired **theory of mind**:* Difficulty reading other people’s facial emotions and states of mind
    - Emotional deficiencies occur early in illness and have a **genetic** basis
    - Toneless voice
  - Inappropriate motor behavior; catatonia
    - Inappropriate *motor behavior,* with motionless **catatonia** or senseless, compulsive actions

## **14-15. Distinguish between** ***chronic schizophrenia*** **and** ***acute schizophrenia.***

- **Chronic schizophrenia** (also called **process** *schizophrenia*)
  - Symptoms usually appear by late adolescence or early adulthood
  - As people age, psychotic episodes last longer and recovery periods shorten
- **Acute schizophrenia** (also called **reactive** *schizophrenia*)
  - Can begin at any age, frequently occurs in response to an emotionally traumatic event
  - Has extended recovery periods
  - Often **positive** symptoms that respond to drug therapy

## **14-16. Identify the brain abnormalities associated with schizophrenia.**

- **Brain abnormalities**
- **Dopamine** overactivity
  - Resulting hyper-responsive dopamine system could intensify brain signals, creating positive symptoms
- Schizophrenia involves several brain regions and their interconnections
-
-

## **14-17. Identify the prenatal events associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia.**

- **Prenatal environment and risk**
  - Risk factors
    - Low birth weight; maternal diabetes; older paternal age; oxygen deprivation during delivery
  - Mid-pregnancy virus infection and fetal brain development
    - Country-specific **-----** epidemic
    - Birth in densely populated areas
    - Birth in winter and spring months
    - Mother’s flu infection during pregnancy

## **14-18. Describe how genes influence schizophrenia.**

- **Genetic Influences**
  - Schizophrenia is a group of disorders influenced by many genes, each with very small effects
    - Some influence the activity of **dopamine** and other brain neurotransmitters
    - Others affect the production of **myelin**
    - **epigenetic** factors influence gene expression
**Odds of being diagnosed**
- General population: **1 in 100**
- Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia varies with one’s genetic relatedness to someone having this disorder
- Across countries, barely more than 1 in 10 fraternal twins, but 5 in 10 identical twins, share a schizophrenia diagnosis (Data from Gottesman, 2001)

## **14-19. Describe** ***dissociative disorders,*** **and discuss why they are controversial.**

### **Dissociative disorders**

- -----, rare disorders in which conscious awareness becomes separated (dissociated) from previous memories, thoughts, and feelings; fugue state
**Dissociative identity disorder (DID)**
- Formerly called **multiple personality** disorder
- Two or more distinct identities—each with its own voice and mannerisms—seem to control the person’s behavior
**Understanding dissociative identity disorder**
- First formal code for the disorder appeared in an earlier DSM edition
- The current criteria are in DSM-5
- The number of displayed identities increased when DID was publicized
  - Could DID be an extension of normal capacity for identity shifts?
  - Increased dramatically in the late twentieth century
  - Is rarely found outside North America
  - May merely be **role-playing** by people who are vulnerable to therapists’ suggestions
- Other theories:
  - Viewed by some **psychodynamic** theorists as a manifestation of feelings of anxiety
  - Viewed by some **learning** theorists as a response learned when behaviors are reinforced by anxiety-reduction
  - Included by some clinicians under the umbrella of **post-traumatic stress disorder**
  -

## **14-20. Identify the three clusters of personality disorders, and describe the behaviors and brain activity that characterize the antisocial personality.**

### **Personality Disorders**

- Inflexible and enduring **behavior** patterns that impair **social** functioning
- These disorders form three clusters, characterized by:
  - **anxiety** (e.g., *avoidant personality disorder)*
  - **eccentric or odd behaviors** (e.g., *schizotypal personality disorder)*
  - **dramatic or impulsive behaviors** (e.g., *borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder,* & *antisocial personality disorder)*

### **Antisocial personality disorder**

- Lower emotional intelligence
- Lack of **conscience** for wrongdoing, even toward friends and family members
- Often impulsiveness, fearlessness, irresponsibility
- **Criminals?**
  - Criminality is not an essential component of antisocial behavior
  - Many criminals do not fit the description of antisocial personality disorder (since they show responsible concern for their friends and family members)

### **Understanding antisocial personality disorder**

- **Biological factors**
  - Genetic influences, Brain structure, and the environment
  - Biological relatives of people with antisocial and unemotional tendencies are at increased risk for antisocial behavior.
  - Some specific genes identified as more common in those with antisocial personality disorder
    - These genes also increase the risk for **substance use** **disorder** (often appears in combination)
  - **Low** autonomic nervous system arousal in situations others would find unnerving
  - **Genetic** predispositions may interact with the **environment** to produce the altered brain activity associated with antisocial personality disorder

## 14-21. Identify the three main eating disorders, and explain how biological, psychological, and social-cultural influences make people more vulnerable to them

### **Eating disorders**

- **Anorexia** **nervosa:** Person (usually adolescent female) maintains a starvation diet but is significantly underweight
  - Continue to diet and sometimes exercise excessively because they view themselves as overweight
- **Bulemia** **nervosa:** Person alternates binge eating (usually of high-calorie foods) with purging (by vomiting or laxative use), sometimes followed by fasting or excessive exercise
- **Binge eating** **disorder:** Significant binge eating, followed by distress, disgust, or guilt, but without the compensatory purging or fasting that marks bulimia nervosa
- American rates: 0.6% anorexia, 1% bulimia, and 2.8% binge-eating

### **Factors influencing eating disorders**

- Family environment and characteristics
  - Family environment is often **competitive**, **high-achieving**, and **protective**
  - Those with eating disorders often have low self-evaluations, set perfectionistic standards, and are intensely concerned with how others perceive them
    - Low self-esteem and negative emotions interact with stressful life experiences
- Heredity
  - Occurs more in **identical** twins than **fraternal** twins
- Cultural and gender components
  - Ideal body shapes vary across **cultures** and **time**
- Peer effects
- Media influence
