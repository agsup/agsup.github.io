#OOP 
- ##### Have a root object type that can only be truly used as more specific types
	- Ex. Shape abstract class has derived classes Square and Circle
		- You cannot use the Shape class itself, doesn't make any sense
- ##### Virtual Method ^fa89f3
	- If a class has a v-table, it is a *polymorphic type* ^e4a32a
		- Note: a polymorphic type should always have a virtual destructor
	- A virtual method is _pure_ if it has no code in it ^4e6ace
		- Note: a class with a pure virtual method in it is by definition an abstract class
- You can point to an abstract class ^7c273a
	- This means that you can have a pointer that can symbolize any of the children of the base class
		- Ex. You can have a Shape pointer that can point to any type of Shape (Squares, Triangles, etc.)
	- You can identify the exact (dynamic) type/compare types  by using `typeid()`
		- Dynamic vs. Static types
			- Dynamic is the specific type of object (Square, Triangle, etc.)
			- Static is the type of object 
			- One way to remember it is that static can only "see" the front of the object (the base class portion) while dynamic can see deeper into the object (the derived class portion tacked onto the end)
		- Note: Must `#include <typeinfo>` to use this
