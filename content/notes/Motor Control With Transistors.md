### A Transistor is a Digital Switch
- CMOS Digital Transistors
	- Has three terminals
		- Source (Input power)
		- Gate (control voltage)
		- Drain (output)
	- 2 Types
		- PMOS (Positive)
			- Doped (has impurities injected) to be a PNP Junction in silicon
			- Closes when gate = 0
		- NMOS (Negative)
			- Inversion of the PMOS
			Doped to be an NPN Junction
			Closes when gate = 1
- H-Bridge with Transistors
	- Transistors in a rectangle around a motor
	- Different configurations of transistor states make positive or negative charge through the motor, resulting in a clockwise/counterclockwise motion
