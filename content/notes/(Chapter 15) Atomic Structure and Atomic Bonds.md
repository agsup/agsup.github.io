<h1 style="text-align:center;">Atomic Structure and Atomic Bonds</h1>

- ## 1. Electron-Dot Structures
	- pictured [[FP08LXCnTNK39AwhobDS_electron-dot-diagram-for-oxygen-excellent-design.png|here]]
	- Number of Rings = Number of Rows on Periodic Table
	- Number of Electrons = Orbital Number (referenced [[4-11 (Elements)#Orbital Notation|here]])
	- Lewis Dot Structure: a diagram that shows the valence electrons of an element
		- Only the electrons in the outermost ring of an Electron-Dot Structure
		- Only for first two and last six columns of the Periodic Table (not the transition metals)
		- Order is important: Add electrons <u>clockwise</u>
		- Octet Rule: All atoms want full valence rings
		- Family 1 has 1 valence electron, so is charged +1
		- Family 2 is charged +2, 3 is +3, 4 is +4, 5 is -3, 6 is -2, and 7 is -1
			- 8 is noble gases, so they don't bond with anything
			- With the charge values, it is relative to full valence = 0
- ## 2. The Formation of Ions
- ## 3. Ionic Bonds
	- Bond occurs between opposite sides of the periodic table
	- Example: NaCl is bonded because Na has 1 electron, and Cl needs one electron
	- Electrons are "shared"
	- Carbon can bond to itself endlessly, which is why graphite, diamonds, graphene, etc. exist.
- ## 4. Metallic Bonds
	- Free flow of electrons
	- Only for metals
	- Cause of their conductivity
	- Metals atoms are easily able to share all of their electrons with each other
- ## 5. Covalent Bonds
- ## 6. Polar Covalent Bonds
	- Nonpolar Covalent Bond: The two atoms are the same and electrons are shared evenly
	- Polar Covalent Bond: The atoms are different, so electrons are shared unevenly (pulled more towards one atom than to the other)
	- Electronegativity: The ability of bonded atoms to pull more on shared electrons
		- Greater electronegativity means greater pulling power
		- The top right corner of the Periodic Table is the most electronegative, while the bottom left is the least electronegative
			- Most electronegative is Fluorine, the least is Francium
			- This obviously excludes noble gases
			- 
- ## 7. Polarity of Water
	- Slightly negative on one end, slightly positive on the other
