The usage of this promise to explain properties of God's mission is profound to me and I think the parallels here would be very useful for better processing God's reasons for wanting to spread his kingdom.\n\n### Blessing as Transformation\n\nThis article does a good job of touching on all of the benefits that can come from blessing while also making sure to note misconceptions about being blessed (for example, \"prosperity gospel\"). I like the way it tackles different aspects of blessing one at a time, and in great detail. Something I can apply from this article is being more mindful of God's promise to bless the nations, not with a flawed view of what blessing means but through sharing the Gospel with those around me and explaining more accurately what blessings mean.\n\n### Witness to the World\n\n\n\n### The Gospel of the Kingdom\n\n## Quiz 2\n\n### The Master's Plan\n\n### Beyond Loving the World\n\n### Life on Purpose\n\n### Culture, Worldview and Contextualization\n\nOne of the things I found especially notable and feel strongly about was the danger of syncretism in the church, especially in the United States. While every first-world country has this problem to an extent, the United States has a particularly large national ego, by which I mean they believe that they're the only country in the world, or (at worst) the only country that matters. I believe that international discussion about what each culture defines certain terms as is very important to have a mutual understanding while discussing important matters. I think the title of that section, \"Contextualizing Christianity Is Very Risky\", is very apt. An example of this recently is a discussion that my girlfriend and I had about what love means. We both had somewhat similar definitions of the word, but there were plenty of differences in how we process and think about love. Because we had that discussion, the words \"I love you\" carry much more meaning. I think that discussing definitions of these terms between cultures will have an equally powerful effect on how we discuss Christianity.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.031713741Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bible":{"title":"","content":"\n1. David had many very positive contributions to Israel. Repeatedly in 2nd Samuel, it is said that David brought great military victories. David is also said to have killed \"tens of thousands\" as opposed to Saul's \"thousands\" (1 Sam 18), which further demonstrates his military prowess. David was also a good role model to his country, as he was a man of good morals. Even when he fails God and his people, he repents and turns towards God rather than away from Him. Solomon also did a lot of good for his people. As a very wise king, he catapults Israel into a season of affluence and splendor, and is gains Israel high respect among surrounding nations. However, these kings are not infallible. David commits adultery and murder, then tries to cover up both. Solomon in his later years loses his focus and starts gaining a massive number of concubines, who all turn him away from the Lord. These two kings are highly honored in scripture despite these transgressions because of their contributions to Israel, David in his military prowess and Solomon in his wisdom and organizational/management abilities.\n   \n2. King Ahab was one of the worst kings of Israel to ever live. He was notably petty, as shown in his killing of Naboth for his vineyard. He and his wife Jezebel followed Baal, and led Israel into a time of chaos. Elijah tried to reform Israel in the time of King Ahab. Elijah faced followers of Baal on Mount Carmel and proved God's might on the mountain, though Ahab remained in denial God's greatness. Ahab was unfortunately so antagonistic that Elijah was unable to postpone Israel's downfall for long, and was taken up into heaven shortly after the end of Ahab's reign. Judah also had some bad kings, Manasseh being one of the most notable. He rebuilt idols after his father had destroyed them. He also was said to have shed a large amount of innocent blood, leading to him being a king that was disliked by God and his nation alike.\n   \n3. Ezra helped bring about major changes after the Jews' return from exile. He helped the Jews rediscover the Torah and their traditions. More than that, Ezra helped the Jews remember how to be faithful and subservient to God. Another influential leader, Esther, saved her people from certain doom. She was assigned a position of power by the king of Persia, and because of her position she was able to prevent a genocide plot from Haman, an enemy of her people and her family. She helped not only to prevent the death of her people, but also helped her people protect themselves and continue to grow after their period of exile. Cyrus, though not a Jewish leader, was very influential in the salvation of the Jews as he was the first leader to allow Israel to return to their homeland to worship their God. After these leaders, a Messiah was still necessary because the practices of the Jews were focused on recovering what they had before their exile. The purpose of the Messiah's arrival was to tell the Jews how they could change and improve, and furthermore to inform the Jews of God's new commands for his people.\n   \n4. The Old Testament is very valuable for guiding how we live today. One of the many things that it teaches very well is devotion to God. Stories such as Noah's Ark in Genesis, Gideon's March around Jericho in Judges, and Moses' Triumph over Egypt in Exodus show directly how total devotion and trust in God earns his favor, which can manifest itself as success in one's challenges. The Old Testament is also really good at reminding modern Christians that God is powerful. This is shown during Elijah's sacrifice at Mount Carmel in 1 Kings, and the consuming of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis. However, more than anything, the Old Testament gives the modern Christian context for the stories that they read from the New Testament. Having this information allows the modern Christian to further appreciate the journey the world took to get to Jesus as Messiah. Stories such as Ezra's revival of the temple and Israel gathering together to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah display this perfectly. These stories aren't just a look into an ancient culture, but a look into the complete story of how Jesus cane into the world. The Old Testament is an invaluable resource to the modern Christian because it answers questions that so many Christians have about topics like the creation of the world, the capabilities of our God, and the ways in which God has worked historically and how he tends to work now.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.031713741Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bible-Exam-Unit-3":{"title":"","content":"# Q1\nJoshua: Describe in what ways the conquest of Canaan was complete, what ways it was incomplete, and how Christians might explain this violence in the OT. Be sure to discuss all three major battles for Canaan at Jericho, Ai, and **Ḥaṣor.**\n\nOne of the ways the Conquest of Canaan was complete is that Israel successfully eradicated a large enough group of powers to avoid being taken over, which allowed them to lay claim to their land (Joshua 12). At Jericho, the Israelites were able to trust God to deliver the city into their hands, and after marching around the city for a week and after yelling as instructed by God, the city fell. At Ai, the same would be said if not for Achan. Achan had stolen from the spoils of war in Babylonia, which were meant to be reserved for the Lord. Because of this, Israel lost their first battle against Ai, and after stoning Achan and returning the stolen possessions, Israel won their second battle against Ai (Joshua 7-8).  God also allowed the Israelites to win at Ḥaṣor against all of the northern kingdoms. After killing all of their armies, Israel went after the kingdoms directly, killing their kings and taking their land (Joshua 11). However, Their conquest was incomplete in many ways that would haunt them later. The Israelites spared a few countries who would later return with a vengeance, as is clearly shown in Judges 1. This explains violence in the Old Testament by showing that Israel was significantly weaker than any other nation in the region, including Ai with they had underestimated. However, God wanted to show his might to the people of the region as well as to the Israelites, so he ordered the Israelites to consume the land.\n\n# Q2\nJudges: Choose 2 of the following 4 questions to answer in your essay: (a) Does God give up on people, (b) Is it more important to save a life or keep a vow, (c) Does God work through wicked people, and (d) Is it better to have a bad king or no king at all? Be sure to use 3 judges as examples in your answers to these 2 questions.\n\nGod works through wicked people constantly. One great example of this is the story of Samson. Despite being selfish and defiant towards God during the entirety of his time as a judge, God uses Samson to deliver a huge blow to the Philistines when he collapses the temple of their god on top of them (Judges 16), freeing the Israelites from their captivity. Even is his disobedience Samson was fighting the Philistines by burning their crops and killing them in droves because of what had happened with his Philistine wife. This shows that God's power can be displayed even through wicked people like Samson. I also believe that it is more important to keep a vow (to the Lord) than it is to save a life. Jephthah made a rash vow in his desperation that resulted in him having to sacrifice the first thing to come out of his door as a burnt offering. This happened to be his daughter. Israel even made a rash vow as a nation by allowing Abimelech to rise to power. He was then so hated by the people that he was killed, and through that killing God renconciled the deaths of Abimelech's seventy brothers by his own hand. Through this, it is clear that God can work through wicked people, but also that it is more important to keep a vow with the Lord, but also not to make rash vows to begin with.\n\n# Q3\n1 Samuel \u0026 Ruth: Describe the rise of Saul, the fall of Saul, and what caused the shift. Then, in 2-3 sentences, consider 1 character from the book of Ruth who is most like or unlike Saul and describe why this is the case.\n\nSaul is one of God's anointed, and was a very kingly man in all traditional senses of the word. He was tall, strong, and charismatic; he was exactly what the people of Israel wanted. Saul then does many good deeds as king, but is rebuked by Samuel when he did what he saw fit in regards to his fight at Gilgal rather than trust God. This is where Saul's fall starts, as he strays further and further from the will of God. This Samuel tells him that he will not be visiting him anymore because of his rejection of God. I think this shift is caused because Saul starts to realize the amount of power he has as king that he gains from his subjects, and starts forgetting that God is his true source of power as king. Because of this, he starts doing what he sees fit rather than consulting God. In the book of Ruth, the one who is most unlike Saul is likely Ruth herself. This is because Saul is chosen from a young age because of his kingly appearance to rule Israel, while Ruth is a servant widow who is viewed as low by society, and is accepted by Boaz because of her heart, not her appearance. In addition, because of his actions, Saul is not a part of Jesus' lineage, but Ruth is a part of Jesus' lineage because of her actions.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.031713741Z","tags":null},"/notes/Chapter-13-Personality":{"title":"","content":"#Psychology \n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003eChapter 13: Personality\u003c/h1\u003e\nCheck [[PSY 2010 Ch. 13 Notes.docx]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:16.943712225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Chapter-14-Elements-of-Chemistry":{"title":"","content":"#PhysicalScience \n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003eElements of Chemistry\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n- ## Physical and Chemical Properties\n\t- Physical Properties: properties of a material that can be changed without altering the material's chemistry\n\t\t- Ex.

Identify the three main eating disorders, and explain how biological, psychological, and social-cultural influences make people more vulnerable to them.\n### **Eating disorders**\n- \u003cu\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnorexia\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e **nervosa:** Person (usually adolescent female) maintains a starvation diet but is significantly underweight\n    - Continue to diet and sometimes exercise excessively because they view themselves as overweight\n- \u003cu\u003e\u003cb\u003eBulemia\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e **nervosa:** Person alternates binge eating (usually of high-calorie foods) with purging (by vomiting or laxative use), sometimes followed by fasting or excessive exercise\n- \u003cu\u003e\u003cb\u003eBinge eating\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e **disorder:** Significant binge eating, followed by distress, disgust, or guilt, but without the compensatory purging or fasting that marks bulimia nervosa\n- American rates: 0.6% anorexia, 1% bulimia, and 2.8% binge-eating\n### **Factors influencing eating disorders**\n- Family environment and characteristics\n    - Family environment is often \u003cu\u003ecompetitive\u003c/u\u003e, \u003cu\u003ehigh-achieving\u003c/u\u003e, and \u003cu\u003eprotective\u003c/u\u003e\n    - Those with eating disorders often have low self-evaluations, set perfectionistic standards, and are intensely concerned with how others perceive them\n        - Low self-esteem and negative emotions interact with stressful life experiences\n- Heredity\n    - Occurs more in \u003cu\u003eidentical\u003c/u\u003e twins than \u003cu\u003efraternal\u003c/u\u003e twins \n- Cultural and gender components\n    - Ideal body shapes vary across \u003cu\u003ecultures\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003etime\u003c/u\u003e\n- Peer effects\n- Media influence\n\n# [[Final Study Guide|next]]\n\n[[Kahoot]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:16.943712225Z","tags":null},"/notes/Chapter-15-Atomic-Structure-and-Atomic-Bonds":{"title":"","content":"#PhysicalScience \n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align:center;\"\u003eAtomic Structure and Atomic Bonds\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n- ## 1.

The Formation of Ions\n- ## 3. Ionic Bonds\n\t- Bond occurs between opposite sides of the periodic table\n\t- Example: NaCl is bonded because Na has 1 electron, and Cl needs one electron\n\t- Electrons are \"shared\"\n\t- Carbon can bond to itself endlessly, which is why graphite, diamonds, graphene, etc. exist.\n- ## 4. Metallic Bonds\n\t- Free flow of electrons\n\t- Only for metals\n\t- Cause of their conductivity\n\t- Metals atoms are easily able to share all of their electrons with each other\n- ## 5. Covalent Bonds\n- ## 6. Polar Covalent Bonds\n\t- Nonpolar Covalent Bond: The two atoms are the same and electrons are shared evenly\n\t- Polar Covalent Bond: The atoms are different, so electrons are shared unevenly (pulled more towards one atom than to the other)\n\t- Electronegativity: The ability of bonded atoms to pull more on shared electrons\n\t\t- Greater electronegativity means greater pulling power\n\t\t- The top right corner of the Periodic Table is the most electronegative, while the bottom left is the least electronegative\n\t\t\t- Most electronegative is Fluorine, the least is Francium\n\t\t\t- This obviously excludes noble gases\n\t\t\t- \n- ## 7.

To raise a fool, do nothing\n- Teaching a child grants them wisdom\n\n## Stage 2: Folly as Sport\n\n- Disregarding discipline\n- Repeating foolish behavior\n- Enjoying folly\n\n## Stage 3: Beyond Correction\n\n- Hates the idea of knowledge\n- 2 Factors\n\t- Thinks they're right\n\t- Always takes the path of least resistance (fast money, short-term gain, etc.)\n- They are a menace to society\n- The only solution is corporal punishment\n\n## Stage 4: Blaming Everything But Themselves\n\n- These fools should only expect disgrace\n- The fool's character leads to their downfall\n- They are self-destructive, then they hold everyone else responsible\n- Beware of this fool, or they will blame you for their

An unexpected effect was that bedtime shifted earlier by 15 minutes. Following the time change, fewer students reported daytime sleepiness (49.1% to 20.0%), sleepiness in class (85.1% to 60.5%), and falling asleep in class (38% to 18%).\"\n\t- \"Sustained wakefulness can impair performance.

An irregular bedtime, frequent naps, late-night activities, or weekend sleeping-in can scramble your body’s normal sleep/wake schedules.

Product was developed\n\t2. Product was installed on client's computer\n\t3. Any changes made to the product post-installation were considered maintenance\n- This is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003etemporal definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Pre- or Post- installation determined whether an action was considered development or maintenance\n\t- This is very inconsistent, as the same action can be considered development or maintenance depending on timing alone\n\t- This is unrealistic for two other reasons:\n\t\t1. Long development timelines can mean that the client's requirements could change\n\t\t2. This definition also facilitates building everything from scratch with every product, which is uneconomical\n- A more modern approach is a \u003cu\u003e\u003ci\u003eoperational definition\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- Maintenance only occurs when a fault is fixed or the requirements change\n\t- This definition of maintenance is referred to as *modern maintenance* (or, just maintenance)\n\n### 1.3.2: The Importance of Postdelivery Maintenance\n- Only good products deserve maintenance, bad products are thrown out\n- Software is supposed to reflect a changing world, therefore adaptation is required for relevance\n- More and more of a product's total cost is in postdelivery maintenance (70-80% for many organizations)\n- Conversely to how new coding techniques should be considered in development, new (better) coding techniques should certainly be implemented in postdelivery as larger amounts of time/money can be saved","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.4":{"title":"","content":"# 1.4: Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects\n#SoftwareEngineering \n- ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.5":{"title":"","content":"#SoftwareEngineering ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.6":{"title":"","content":"#SoftwareEngineering ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.7":{"title":"","content":"#SoftwareEngineering ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.8":{"title":"","content":"#SoftwareEngineering ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-1.9":{"title":"","content":"#SoftwareEngineering ","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-Chapter-1":{"title":"","content":"# Chapter 1:  Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering\n#SoftwareEngineering\n## [[OOSE 1.1|1.1: Historical Aspects]]\n## [[OOSE 1.2|1.2: Economic Aspects]]\n## [[OOSE 1.3|1.3: Maintenance Aspects]]\n## [[OOSE 1.4|1.4: Requirements, Analysis, and Design Aspects]]\n## [[OOSE 1.5|1.5: Team Development Aspects]]\n## [[OOSE 1.6|1.6: Why There Is No Planning Phase]]\n## [[OOSE 1.7|1.7: Why There Is No Testing Phase]]\n## [[OOSE 1.8|1.8: Why There Is No Documentation Phase]]\n## [[OOSE 1.9|1.9: The Object-Oriented Paradigm]]\n## [[OOSE 1.10|1.10: Terminology]]\n## [[OOSE 1.11|1.11: Ethical Issues]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/OOSE-Notes":{"title":"","content":"# Object Oriented Software Engineering Notes\n#SoftwareEngineering \n- [[OOSE Chapter 1|Chapter 1:  Introduction to Object Oriented Software Engineering]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.115715188Z","tags":null},"/notes/Op-Amps":{"title":"","content":"## Enable Math Operators on signals in the analog domain\n### 2 Rules:\n- Voltage diff between inputs is 0 \n- No current flowing through either input \n### 5 Types:\n- Inverting Amplifier:\n\t- $V_b = \\frac{-Rf}{R_{in}}V_{in}$\n- Summer:\n\t- $V_0 = \\frac{-Rf}{R_1}V_1 + \\frac{-Rf}{R_2}V_2 + {...}$\n- TODO: fill in the other type of Op Amp Circuits\n### [[Op Amps + Capacitors]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.187716428Z","tags":null},"/notes/Op-Amps-+-Capacitors":{"title":"","content":"#Circuits \n\n[[Op Amps]]\n### Low Pass Filter: Active\n- Formula:\n\t- $V_0 = -\\frac{Zf}{R_{in}}V_{in}$\n\t\t- Note: $V_0$ is inverting\n\t- $Z_f = \\frac{R_f}{R_f\\cdot j \\cdot \\omega \\cdot C_f + 1}$\n\t- So, $V_0= -\\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}(\\frac{1}{R_f\\cdot j \\cdot \\omega \\cdot C_f + 1})V_{in}$\n### High Pass Filter: Active\n- Formula:\n\t- $V_0 = -\\frac{Rf}{Z_{in}}V_{in}$\n\t- $Z_{in} = R_{in} + \\frac{1}{j\\omega c} = \\frac{R_{in} \\cdot j\\cdot \\omega \\cdot C + 1}{j\\omega c}$\n\t- So, $V_0 = -\\frac{Rf \\cdot j\\cdot  \\omega\\cdot C_{in}}{R_{in}\\cdot j\\cdot \\omega\\cdot  C_{in} + 1}V_{in}$\nCapacitors are used to smooth out voltages\n- Exponential PWM output\n\t- Pulse Width Modulation\n\t- if `analogWrite(3, 128)` (arg 1 is a pin#, arg 2 is an 8 bit val), then wave is a square wave\n\t- `analogWrite(3, 64)` would be a 25% duty cycle\n\t- This can produce smoother (sinusoidal) waves if the output is run through a resistor, then split between a new output and a capacitor (capacitor goes to ground)\n\t\t- Resistance has to be a specific value, which needs to be calculated\n\t\t- $fc = \\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}$","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.187716428Z","tags":null},"/notes/Parametric-Polymorphism":{"title":"","content":"#OOP\n### Templates (think `template \u003ctypename T\u003e`)\n- Note: templates are \u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e code.

name of class purely for debug purposes\n\t- Overloads `=`/`!=` operators\n\n## Converting between types by reference\n- We can convert a derived class ptr to a base class ptr (because a Student

the feature\n\t\t- This does \u003cb\u003enot\u003c/b\u003e change the address, but it does change how C++ treats the data\n\t\t\t- Example, typecasting an `int` to a `long` makes that pointer try to

`reinterpret_cast\u003ctype\u003e(value)`\n\t\t- Anything else (e.g., float to int\u0026)\n\t\t- Make sure you know what you're doing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Polymorphism|back to root]]\n\u003ca

Define timeboxing. Define feature creep.  \n    \n- a\n      \n14. Who is Jacobsen? What is Rational Software? What do these have to do with software engineering?  \n- a\n15. Where did the Rational Unified Process get its name? i.e. Where did “rational” and “unified” come from?  \n\n- Rational: Company Name\n- Unified: JB\u0026R (Jacobsen from Objectory, Booch from Ericcson, and Rumbaugh of General Electric) all unified their processes for software engineering\n\n16. Explain, in as much detail as possible, the following statement: “The Unified Process is use-case driven”.  \n    \n- Explain the 5 steps (req, analy, design, implem, and test) and how the use-case drives each of them\n- Be as wordy as possible\n\n17. How do JB\u0026R define the difference between iteration and incrementation?\n    \n- Three Unified developers behind RUP, from JBR reading assignment. They define the difference as iteration = steps in workflow, increment = growth in product.\n\n18. Diagram and label these software life cycle models: (note the version from class)  \n    \n- Waterfall (OOSE fig. 2.9)\n- Iterative – it will take time to learn this diagram – label all the phases, disciplines, and iterations – note when each discipline rises and falls. This is the most important one!  \n- These are in \"brief intro.pdf\" on canvas\n\n19. What activities take place during the requirements workflow? Analysis? Design? Implementation?  \n- This is not going to be on the test, too detailed (but is in OOSE ch 3 notes)\n20. What are the CMM and ISO 9000 standards and what are they trying to address?\n\n- What are they, how are they the same?\n- Grading a company's ability in SE\n- They are trying to address *the crisis* (the 29% success rate)\n\n21. List three barriers or challenges to requirements elicitation, as discussed in class.\n- a\n22. List at least five of the standard requirements elicitation techniques which were discussed in class.

Pencil/Paper Flip-charts\n\t2. PowerPoint\n\t3. Prototypes\t    \n- Note: Lower-tech = more receptive to change\n\t    \n\n28. Explain Brook’s law.  \n- a\n29. What is the difference between a “program” and a “programming systems product”, as defined by Brooks?  \n\n- The easy way to answer the question is to draw the graph\n| prog prod        |                   | prog sys prod | \n| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |\n| 🔼3x complicated | ↗️                |               |\n| prog             | ▶️ 3x complicated | prog sys      |\n- Diff is in complexity and cost (program is simple, prog sys prod is 9x as complicated)\n\n30. What are the pluses and minuses of programming as an activity, according to Brooks? (joys and woes)  \n- a\n31. Explain why Brooks says to “plan to throw one away”.

I feel like my definition of love is similar to yours in many ways, although I personally name it differently. I've always referred to friends that I (by your definition) show platonic affection for as my \"inner circle\". Because definitions are all wibbly wobbly (especially among straight males between other straight males), it's just kind of easier to explain that way. Like, for example, under your definition of platonic love I \"love\" Lawson. One of my best friends easily. But I wouldn't say that to his face because of the connotations behind the word \"love\". It kind of just ends up being more trouble to explain than it's worth, and I prefer to just say that I value him highly as a friend. It's easier to explain it in the context of Godly love, but only barely.\n\nAs for non-platonic love, I totally agree with your definition (in that it's a combination of romance and attraction), but I don't really know how to put it into my own words. The weird thing with me is that I've kind of been tugged into the non-platonic relationships I've been in and just kinda went along with it because when I thought about it, I didn't not like the person in question, and it just kind of worked out (for a while, but with one exception, more details in a little). In my opinion, non-platonic love is (in a way) an emergent property that can start in a number of ways. For some it's through \"concentrated attraction\". For some, it's through an originally platonic relationship. But somehow, it just kind of... happens. And sometimes it doesn't. There's kind of a rhyme/reason behind it, but also not really (otherwise everyone who really loves their field of work and is looking for a partner that shares their interests would be equally attracted to most of their coworkers lol). \n\nAnyways, the exception.\n\nI won't say names because I don't want to affect how you think of this person (I'm 99% sure you know her), but we were talking over text and somehow the subject of our relationship being platonic came up, and she seemed a little hesitant. I asked if she liked me and she said yes. I had my reservations because I've known this person for a very long time, and know what she's like, but I was wondering if she was like that just because she liked me (apparently some people are meaner to people they're attracted to in order to hide their attraction? Idk, psychology is weird lol). So I said that we could try to date, and it turned out alright... kind of. We would watch shows together and kind of just hang out, hold hands, do relationship things, but she was super secretive to her friends about our relationship because she was embarrassed of the inevitable \"I told you so's\" that would ensue, which was fine at the beginning, but was starting to become a stressing point after about a year (to say the least). She was also still kind of mean some of the time, and was a little inconsiderate when it came to people (in general, not just me).\n\nHowever, the thing that really crossed the line for me was when Lawson and I were going to help her and her roommate move into the dorms. I said I'd be free to help at around dinner time because that was when summer band started dinner break. I ask her if she's ready for us to help out. No response. I wait for about an hour, but I have to get dinner before band starts back up so I leave, leaving Lawson to help them on his own. By the time they actually got Lawson to help, he'd been waiting multiple hours. The reason? They were arguing about who was going to get which bed, and just kind of forgot that they'd asked for help and subsequently made the help they asked for wait multiple hours to help them.  I was pissed (perdon mi Francois), so we had a serious discussion about the future of our relationship, being more considerate, and eventually I realized that I couldn't continue the relationship the way that it was going, and we ended up breaking off that part of our relationship. We still talk occasionally, but only as friends (I don't really want to lose a lifelong friend lol).\n\nI think what she wanted out of that relationship was the physical aspect, like hugs, hand holding, sitting close to each other while watching a show, etc. All nice things, but not a basis for a successful relationship on their own. I still don't know whether she was actually attracted to me as a person or just attracted to me because I was her \"type\" (in a physical sense, which I still don't understand as I am literally a spaghetti noodle lol). It kind of showed me the flaw in my \"why not?\" approach to accepting dates. I don't want to be too selective, but I also don't want to enable more situations like this one, and I'm still trying to figure out that balance. It also gave me more of a reason to be more outward in figuring out who I liked, and why.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.343719114Z","tags":null},"/notes/Wisdom-Literature":{"title":"","content":"# Intro to Wisdom Literature \n\n#Wisdom/Prophets\n\n## 3 Books\n\n- Proverbs\n- Job\n- Ecclesiastes\n\n## Context\n\n- General truths (Proverbs 26:4-5)\n- Observations about the world\n- What is the wise thing to do given a situation?\n\n## What is Wisdom?\n\nSophia (Greek)/Hocma (Hebrew): expertise in a given field\n\nThe \"expertise\" that the books are interested in is:\n\n- Moral character\n- Wise vs. Foolish\n- It's about self-control, persistence, and priorities, not about intelligence\n\nWisdom is the expertise to navigate through life because one's *moral character* is strong\n\n## Purpose of Wisdom Literature\n\n\n\n1.

Foundational Material: A friend comes to you with doubts concerning the existence of God. Explain to them the 4-5 sources of divine revelation that support the belief that we can know God, and then give 3 reasons why they can trust that the scriptures we have today are from God and were reliably copied and translated by humans.\n\t- Prompts to help direct your answer:\n\t\t1.  Discuss the 4-5 sources of divine revelation and how each one draws us closer to knowing God.\n\t\t2.  Discuss 3 reasons we can trust that the scriptures we have today reflect the divine revelation God gave the original authors of the Bible through inspiration. (e.g. what was the process of scripture formation? What did the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit contribute? What are reasons to believe the Bible has been reliably copied by scribes? Has been reliably translated by scholars?)\n\t- **My answer: There are four reasons that I have for believing that I can know God. The first of these is reason derived from nature, which tells me that everything in nature had to have a root cause, which I believe is God. This was Aristotle's argument. Another reason I have for my belief is experience, as I have seen the effects of people being blessed and have also experienced the balance of emotions that God has placed, such as the balance between heartache and peace, judgement and acceptance, etc. I also believe that I can know God through Scripture, and there are 3 reasons for this. One of these reasons is that the Bible is one of the most well maintained and consistent documents in human history, which means that it was meticulously copied by generations of scribes, which must mean that the scribes felt so strongly about their beliefs that they made absolutely sure to copy these documents with an accuracy that almost no other copied document has. I also believe that the Scriptures are inspired by God's Spirit. I believe that this inspiration can be compared to human inspiration, meaning that there is still plenty of room for interpretation from both the reader and the writer, but nonetheless it is still inspired by God and therefore is worth taking seriously. I also believe that one can know God because the Scriptures and the canon of the Bible were chosen by those who have known God through those Scriptures before, which gives me confidence that I can also know God through those same Scriptures.**\n\n2. Psalms: The Book of Psalms has been called “a little Bible” and “Israel: The Musical.” Can you tell the story of Israel’s ups and downs using the structure, teachings, and emotions of the Psalter?\n\t- Prompts to help direct your answer:\n\t\t1.  Begin by describing the process of how a song became a Psalm (include the names of some of the authors and the significance of why they might have been involved in writing psalms)\n\t\t2.  Then talk about the theories and most likely purpose of the specific structure of the Psalter.\n\t\t3.  Finally, describe how the 2 main types of Psalms express emotions needed in worship today.\n\t\t4.  Who called it “a little Bible” and what did they mean?\n\t\t5.  What does it mean that the Psalter is a musical about Israel? How does each part contribute to the story?\n\t- **My answer: The story of Israel can be told through the Psalms through a general 5 section order. The first of these sections tells details about Israel's beginnings. Many of these psalms explore emotions of sorrow and cry to God for help, as Israel did in the wilderness after the Exodus. The second section tells of life in the Promised Land. Many of these psalms speak of how God is the protector of Israel, and how God \"brings wars to an end\" (Psalms 46). These psalms revel in God's glorious kingdom and focus on pleasing him in times of plenty. The next section represents Israel's time of exile after the destruction of the temple. In these psalms, it seems as though Israel realizes they have sinned. Many of these psalms are psalms of repentance, of how God makes them strong despite their circumstances. These psalms also say that if only Israel would listen, God might help them escape their predicament. In the Contemporary English Version, the heading for Psalms 82 bluntly states \"Please Do Something, God!\", which I think sums up the emotions felt by many Israelites during that time period. The next section is about Israel's hope for deliverance from their enemies. Many of thee psalms state that God is King, that he is powerful, and that he is the fortress of his people. These Psalms represent Israel exalting God and hoping that he will aid them in their time of need. After this section, the Psalter concludes by discussing Israel's emotions during their deliverance and the following time of restoration. These Psalms express Israel's gratitude by discussing God's ability to work wonders in the lives of his followers, how he helps those in need, and how good he is to his people.**\n\n3. Psalms: A worship leader at a local church asks you to help them understand the 7 types of Psalms so that they can teach their church over the next 2 months. Give them a brief description of each type of psalm (e.g. Imprecatory), an example of each type (e.g. Psalm 35), and the occasion or purpose in which each type would be sung (e.g. in anger). End with 1-2 sentences containing your opinion on which of these 7 types of Psalms is most needed in the church today and why.\n\t- Prompts to help direct your answer:\n\t\t1.  What do we learn from the 2 major types of Psalms?\n\t\t2.  What are the 7 sub-types of Psalms? How would you describe each? What is an example of each? What can we learn by using each type in worship today?\n\t\t3.  Which type do you think we need more of in today’s worship and why?\n\t- **My answer: One of the seven types of Psalms is the Wisdom Psalm, and a good example of this is Psalms 1. These types of psalms contain good advice for Christians. Psalms 1 specifically explains the blessings one will receive from delighting in the Law of the Lord. This type of Psalm should be sung when one needs direction in life or advice towards making a decision. Another type of Psalm is the Torah Psalm. This type of Psalm reviews the instructions of the Torah to be quickly and easily referred to. An example of this type is Psalm 119, the largest chapter in the Bible. This type of Psalm can be sung for the purpose of practicing humility. The Royal Psalms are the type of Psalm that acknowledges God's greatness. An example of this type of psalm is Psalm 24. We can sing this type of psalm to show our appreciation to the Lord and acknowledge and accept his power over us. The next type of Psalm is the Ascent Psalm. A good example of this Psalm is Psalms 46. These Psalms were a good form of gaining confidence in the Lord during ceremonial feasts like Passover and the Feasts of Weeks and Booths. While many of us as Christians do not celebrate these feasts ourselves, we can still gain confidence in the Lord in the same way the Israelites practicing these feasts did. The next type of Psalm are the Lament and Praise Psalms. These Psalms are for lamenting over hardship and praising God for blessings respectively. What these Psalms have in common is that they both end with a praise towards God. What we can learn by singing these is that no matter what we're going through, we can praise God for his power and his ability to listen to our hardships. Examples of these are Psalms 22 and 51 respectively. The hardest type of Psalm to interpret in a helpful way is the Imprecatory Psalm. In these Psalms, the Psalmist asks God to rain curses upon their enemies, often in gruesome detail. While the hearts behind the more gruesome requests  are less than Godly, they still keep in mind that God is in control, and that he will judge as he sees fit. These Psalms are good for expressing anger while still acknowledging that God's will is the final word on what will happen to one's enemies. I think that in the church today, the Psalm we need most is the Lament Psalm. I think that churches today are more than willing to shut down negative emotions in the church, but Lament Psalms show that these emotions are not only good to express, but also that one can express them while still remaining faithful and appreciative of God.**","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.343719114Z","tags":null},"/notes/WordCount":{"title":"","content":"# Word Count\n## Greg Supratman\n### Weaknesses\n- None that are notable, map was done to assignment\n- Could have done extra credit, but studying seemed more important\n### Strengths\n- I feel good about my solutions and my formatting, to me it seems easily readable\n- I watched a video about avoiding code nesting for organization, I feel like it helped my code readability in this assignment","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T16:31:17.343719114Z","tags":null},"/notes/World-Christian/First-Verse-Memorization":{"title":"","content":"#WorldChristian \nhave faith in me, and you will have life-giving water flowing from deep inside you, just as the Scriptures say.
